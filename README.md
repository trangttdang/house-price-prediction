Milestone-3:
- [Tuned LightGBM Model Hyperparameters with Optuna (Jupyter Notebook)](https://github.com/trangttdang/house-price-prediction/blob/main/LightGBM_Optuna_Explanation.ipynb)
- [Deployed model with Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ttd22/house-price-prediction-LightGBM)

Milestone-2:
- Perform the SHAP interpretation of the house price prediction with a simple [LightGBM] model. 
- Produce graphs that show the SHAP values for the features and the SHAP interaction values for these features.

Milestone-1:
- Set up a development environment
- Learn the basics of docker
- Implement Docker in action
